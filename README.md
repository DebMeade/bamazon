This is a storefront where the user can select an item to purchase.  The user is prompted to buy an item listed and choose a quantity to purchase.  If there is enough in stock the order will be placed and the stock will decrease by the amount the user purchased.  If the user selects a quantity that exceeds what is available they will receive a message stating there is not enough in stock to complete the order.  At the end of either outcome the user will be prompted to either purchase something else or not.  If the user elects to purchase another item the process begins again and if not the user will receive a message saying thanks for visiting.
